# NYSE-Data-Analysis-Project

In this project, I go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies using Excel. The goal is to perform an analysis, and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways. A clean data set has been provided for this project.
