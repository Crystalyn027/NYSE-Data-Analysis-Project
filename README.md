# NYSE-Data-Analysis-Project

In this project, I will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. A subset of a large dataset is provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. A smaller subset of the data was used for the project.

I go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies using Excel. The goal is to perform an analysis, and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.
